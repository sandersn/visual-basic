<blockquote>
    <p>When Mario 64 was released, it had a view and control
    style unlike any other currently selling 3D game. It was
    natural and easy to use, and capitalized on the novelty of
    the analog joystick used by the Nintendo 64&trade;. However,
    while it is one of the best control designs around, the
    programmers added some features that allow it to create more
    dramatic shots, but that made it harder(actually more
    aggravating) to use. </p>
    <p>The actual control of Mario 64 is straightforward and so
    easy to use it's almost unconscious for most people. When the
    joystick is pressed 'up'(90º)[Figure 1], Mario runs directly
    away from the camera. When the joystick is pressed 'left' he
    runs 180º to the camera. Note that his movement is <em>always</em>
    relative to the camera.</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="2">Figure 1. 90º movement and
    180º movement, respectively</font></p>
    <p>However, when programming Mario 64, the same concept was
    used as in the Donkey Kong Country series released two years
    earlier: when the character begins moving, the camera waits
    until the character reaches a certain point near the edge of
    the view, then begins to follow him. This concept is nothing
    new and has been used since Super Mario Brothers 1 and
    beyond. However, in DKC, the camera has a wider range before
    following the character, but it 'hurries' to catch up with
    the him when he starts to move. Once he <em>continues</em>
    moving, it assumes a constant rate, much like all older side
    scrolling games. However, when he <em>stops</em> moving, it
    continues moving for a short while and then coasts to a
    stop[Figure 2]. In DKC, this was not a major issue of
    playability, and it was sometimes used to great effect.
    Witness the powder barrels that shot Dunky and Diddly to the
    very right edge of the screen as the camera struggled to keep
    up. However, DKC has one other feature also present in many
    games that copied it: the camera moved so that more of the
    view was visible on the direction that the character was <em>facing</em>.
    This was the biggest control issue in DKC, and it multiplies
    in spades when applied to 3D in Mario64.</p>

    <p><font size="2">Figure 2. Here Sonic Game Gear demonstrates
    the facing method of determining the camera position when
    idle. Note that the camera is slightly more centered when
    moving.</font></p>
    <p>In Mario64, the programmers decided that the camera should
    optimally be positioned behind and above Mario's back, so
    that it pointed the way he was facing. This imitated many
    current 3D games that were had just converted 1st person to
    3rd person(primary example: Tomb Raider® or Jedi&trade;
    Knight®). However, the camera also has simple control
    options present using the 'C' buttons on the N64 controller.
    When an experienced player was preparing for a difficult
    jump, he would adjust the camera so the view closely
    resembled a traditional 2D view[Figure 3]. However, if the
    player waited before making his jump, the camera would begin
    to return to the 'optimal' position behind Mario[Figure 4].
    Thus, in most cases the required jump with the adjusted
    camera would be 180º or 0º(straight left or right). By the
    time the player jumped, the camera might be as much as a
    quarter of the way back to the optimal position. Now when the
    player pushes directly left, as required by his adjustment,
    his jump will be off by around 30º[Figure 5]! Needless to
    say, this resulted in many errors caused solely by the
    drifting camera.</p>

            <h3>2nd person view</h3>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The idea for the 2nd person view originated in console
    RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series by Square&trade;
    and later isometric 3D games such as Mario RPG (also by
    Square®). In them, whenever the character moves, the camera
    follows exactly his position. In other words, the camera's
    position is directly linked to the character's position. The
    same idea is carried over into the 3D world.</p>
    <p>Of note is that in the 2nd person view, control is handled
    <em>exactly</em> the same way as in the Mario64. That is,
    when the player presses 'up' the character moves
    directly(0º) away from the camera. However, the difference
    comes in the way the camera reacts to player movement.</p>
    <p>In the 2nd person view, the camera <em>never</em> moves
    relative to the character unless the player explicitly tells
    it to. Thus, when the character moves left or right, the
    camera moves <em>exactly</em> that much with him. In
    addition, the angle relative to the 'ground' does not change
    either. The x/z(parallel to 'ground') angle is alterable by
    pressing some sort of shortcut key, preferably by 90º
    increments(especially to accomodate those with standard plus
    pad type gamepads)[Figure 6]. The y angle should be alterable
    as well, perhaps through three or four preset angles and
    magnitudes or through a menu option[Figure 7]. Last, for
    completeness the original Tomb Raider view should still be
    present as an option.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The foremost drawback to the 2nd person
    view is of course, the reason that the creators of Mario 64
    made their view act like it does: it is less dramatic.
    However, in an RPG, control is better if it is more precise,
    and a dramatic view usually serves to disguise lower detail
    levels. The question of course remains how to treat y axis
    movement. Probably there will be a upper and lower y limit
    after which they are exceeded, the view begins to follow the
    character again.</font></p>

<p>Note: I have assumed that 0º is to the right and positive
degrees are to the counter clock wise--even if this is
inconvenient for you! In addition, 3D dimensions use the DirectX
right hand rule, with z being into the picture.</p>
