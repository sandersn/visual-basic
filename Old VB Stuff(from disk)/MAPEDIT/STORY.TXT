In this adventure game the player plays the game from the viewpoint of 
three different characters. The characters are chosen at the beginning of
gameplay. Example:

General Storyline:  |it!!!---------------|
The King has been killed! The country is in an uproar! The Prince is 
immediate suspect, because he disappeared the same night that the King was
killed. Some noblemen have encouraged the idea, because they may stand a
chance to gain more power if a different king is on the throne.

The five journey on, meeting more and more strange creatures(maybe mutated)
At last they reach what used to be a thriving border town. Now no humans
live there except the mayor, and he's leaving next Tuesday! The town was
slowly taken over by hordes of dog-men(oddly resembling Goofy). They
were able to talk just enough to make threats to townspeople to get out
of their homes and leave. The mayor thinks that the dog-men came from the
Red Forest, which is two miles north-west of the town. Our heroes decide 
that that is where they should go next. Half a day later, they reach the 
Red Forest. It is dark, gloomy and generally scary. Our heroes nevertheless
put on brave faces and venture into the forest the next morning. They 
fight off many mutated creatures and are almost half-way through the forest
when they spot Bulk's dark shadow!! They chase him and and catch him after
15 minutes. After being scared out of his wits by Bulk, who wants to know
where his ox is, he confesses that he is a hired assassin for the Under-King,
the monarch of the country adjoining. He was the one that killed the king.
He also is forced to reveal that the dog-men are part of a plot to slowly 
take over the as of yet unnamed country that our heroes live in. He tells 
them that there are 10 tunnels criss-crossing underneath the Red Forest, and
connecting tunnels that lead into the border mountains. Our heroes decide to
send Bob and Bulk back to the capital with the assassin in the morning, and 
the other three would continue on to the tunnels to explore and possibly
overturn the Under-King and his Evil plots. 

Here ends Episode 1. To get the rest of the storyline, please send at least 
2.50 (for postage and handling)(not!)to my address, which I'm not going to 
tell you. If you don't want to do that, just scroll down and keep reading.

Episode 2:
The next morning, our heroes wake up to find that the assassin has chewed his
way through the ropes binding him to the tree, and has taken off toward the
tunnels that lead underneath the mountains bordering our heroe's country.
(Yes, I did steal this idea from "Sword of Shannarra")
They hotly pursue him.
