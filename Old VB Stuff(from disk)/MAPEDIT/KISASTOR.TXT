	You are this hero in an unfinished game called Adventures in Time and
Space. One day as you lounge around in the monolithic halls of your programmers
hard drive, you see a faint swirling far in the distance of the Comm hall. It quickly
approaches the section of the hard drive with the game in it, apparently intent on
swallowing the whole game (you included). As you are swept away, you reflect
that some type of horrible mistake must be at the root  of all this. When you come
to, you are in a thin forest holding a whole bunch of ..Camping gear!?! Bows &
Arrows?!? You wonder what is happening. Slowly the details filter into your mind.
You are your brother's squire, and you are both on a three-day hunting trip. Your
brother is dashing up ahead, gloriously unencumbered by any sort of camping
gear, which you are carrying. He crests the next hill. Suddenly, a creaking knight
appears over the hill, taking your brother completely by surprise. The knight
attacks with absolutely no warning, scoring several severe hits on your brother
before he can whip out your family's sword that has been in the family for
generations. He exchanges several blows with the knight, but he just barely
manages to defeat the knight before falling over severely wounded. You try to
help your brother, but there is no hope. He dies, leaving you  stranded two days
march  from home. Suddenly a screech rips through the air. You look up and see
a huge eagle swoop down and carry off your family's sword. You try to give
chase, but the eagle moves many times faster than you. You sadly go back and
gather your things, intent on procuring the family sword, and avenging your
brother. As you pass the fallen knight, you curiously open his visor, hoping to
determine something about your brother's attacker. To your complete
consternation, there is no face behind the visor. You jump back, startled.
Suddenly, smoke emits in huge streams from somewhere inside of the knight. You
decide that now would be a good time to start on your quest and you take off
running.
