	Nathan's Daily [sic] Newsletter*

To you all in the computer club, this is an e-mail that I'm going to try to send out semi-
regularly in hopes of getting everyone to get back going on programming. Since this is the
premier issue this is mostly going to be questions so I can get caught up on what's happening
with everyone. First, what <i>exactly</i> is the status of everyone's ownership of Visual Basic?
<b>Especially</b> you Casey!! Second, are the HTML italics and bolds coming through? If so, this
newsletter will probably start looking very different...If not, I'll go back to using *these*.
Third, what has everyone been talking about the game? I need to know everyone's ideas so that
we can all be on the same track. Fourth, we need to decide what to do to communicate amongst
ourselves(besides this newsletter).

OK. I have not been doing much except a little work improving the scripting commands. There are
now two new sets of commands: the step animation commands that allow you to animate the 
characters just like the Final Fantasy series. The other one is a "warp" command that lets you
warp the NPCs or the player somewhere on the map.

Anyway, this is supposed to be an interactive type of thing, so e-mail me back soon. How often
this comes out kind of rests on how much you all talk back.

		Talk to you later,
	Nathan

OK, everybody: this is going to be short but sweet because I don't have much time. Bear with me 
on the HTML stuff; next issue will probably look a <b>lot</b> better if I remember to look it up.

    First, I have heard from Ryan that everyone else has decided to do an online game. If this is not
OK with you, this is a speak-up-or-forever-hold-your-peace kind of thing! 
    Anyway, now for the plans:
	Ryan, you and I need to start communicating immediately to converge my engine and your engine
(which I am assuming is for communicating between a client copy and a server version of my engine).
to merge them. I need to understand how your engine works and vice versa...e-mail me or something
and we'll get started.
	Casey, you need to start working on class code and battle code and talk to me and Ryan some when
you're ready to stick it in the main engine. Also, could you tell me if you've got VB yet?
(this goes for you too, Ryan; I really hope you can get VB back on your machine soon)
	jederge(JediRJ), I <i>really</i> want you to run through my code again and e-mail me all
the bugs you run into.

Also, I've stuck an idea that's been bugging me for a while together and I'm attaching it to this
newsletter so you all can take a look at it. Ryan, do you remember that 'Surfer' game idea that I told you about
where
the player(and the NPCs) are characters that live inside computers and can travel between them
over the Internet? Anyway, that and Bob's idea of a program to really <i>teach</i> something
kind of stuck together and I thought that maybe you could teach programming pretty visually if
the player was inside of a RPG type game and was a programmer's apprentice. There a lot of 
obstacles to making a <b>real</b> program that does this, so I just put 4 or 5 command buttons
on a form and used OpenTalkBox a lot, and made sort of a demo...Anyway, look at it and tell me
what you think. You need the Talkbox.frm, Talkbox.bas, and Buttons.frm files to <i>run</i> it, 
but you can look at it with notepad without VB anyway. 
	RJ, I want you to try to break the logic on the exercise and see if you can fool it
into thinking that you passed when you didn't(or vice versa)(one way I already thought of is to
press Cancel on the Inputbox that tells you to type in the code :)

	Ryan, about your tile idea and dynamic terrain for a 3-D engine; I can think it would be
easy to detect for a bomb-blast and make a <b>whole tile</b> burnt-grassly, simply by have a
burnt-grass tile stashed away for that particular terrain. Or as you said, just simply the texture,
but I am stumped about dynamically altering the terrain even if we used tiles. We might use 
a kind of 'incidence record' of the blast(or road), but they would pile up <i>really</i> fast.

That's about all for this time, so tell me if the HTML worked!!
